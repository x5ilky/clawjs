# Claw

Claw is a library to make scratch projects using typescript.

## Documentation

Examples for the use of the library will be written in the future.
I do not *yet* intend to write documentation for the IR, but if you are curious to the format, look at some files in the `examples/bytecode/` directory or look at `ir/parser.ts/`.
