# Claw

Claw is a library to make scratch projects using typescript.

## Documentation

Find simple examples for the language in [/examples/typescript](/examples/typescript/).

I do not *yet* intend to write documentation for the IR, but if you are curious to the format, look at some files in the `examples/bytecode/` directory or look at `ir/parser.ts/`.
